Python code to manage the analysis of climate model outputs published in the CMIP5 and CORDEX archives

This package provides simple tools to process data from the CMIP5 and CORDEX archives distributed 
by the Earth System Grid Federation.

This package was developed by F. B. Laliberte and P. J. Kushner as part of the "ExArch: Climate analytics
on distributed exascale data archives" G8 Research Initiative grant. http://proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/exarch

This version is a major rewrite from earlier versions.
